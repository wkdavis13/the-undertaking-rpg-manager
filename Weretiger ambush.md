The party was ambushed by a [Weretiger Tribe](Weretiger%20Tribe.md) that they had previously ran into when the saved [Mi’kel](Mi%E2%80%99kel.md).  
The tribe was hired by [Ereagar](Ereagar.md) to capture people from [Mi’kel](Mi%E2%80%99kel.md)’s colony which worked in the tribes’ favor as they have a [feud](feud.md) with the colony.   
Why [Ereagar](Ereagar.md) hired the weretigers is unknown to the party at this time, and the party does not know that the weretigers were hired in the first place.   
The reason why Ereagar hired the tribe to capture members of the colony was to have subjects/victims for his experiment in the underground city. Ultimately this method would be too slow for him, and he would then slaughter the colony with the now cursed [Gauntlet of Ephiritus](Gauntlet%20of%20Ephiritus.md).
